description:
  The `detrospector' program generates random text conforming to the general
  style and diction of a given source document.  It associates each
  `k'-character substring of the source document with a probability
  distribution for the next character.  These distributions are used to
  iteratively pick new characters for output.  In other words, it samples a
  Markov chain derived from the source document.
  .
  Run `detrospector' `-?' for usage information.  The program has several
  modes.  It can generate random text, or invent individual random words which
  are not found in a dictionary.  These modes require a chain file, which is
  built from a source document in another mode.
  .
  Design goals include speed and full Unicode support.  I welcome suggestions
  and patches regarding any aspect of this program.
